It is a fraction or a percentage of the total number of possible votes.

\asubsection{Proxy Ballot}
A Proxy Vote is defined as any ballot that was cast by one member on behalf of another member.

Abstentions are counted towards a Quorum, but not towards the Total Number of Votes Cast used to determine if a vote passes or not.
\asubsection{Vote Counters}
The current President of the Open Works Collective is a vote counter and will additionally select two other members to count votes.

\asection{Types of Voting}
\asubsection{Scheduled Vote}
\asubsubsection{Method of Vote}
Votes are cast on paper ballots, which provide a means to indicate every possible option in the vote.
A ballot is then distributed to each acitve Open Works Collective member that is eligible to cast a vote and then votes are collected in the designated ballot box for a pre-specified length of time.
At the end of the voting period, the Chair of the Vote collects the ballots, closing the voting period.
The Vote Counters then tally the results.

For constitutional modification, candidate selection, and officer removal votes, the voting period must be at least forty-eight (48) hours in length.
For any other type of vote, the voting period must be at least twenty-four (24) hours.

\asubsection{Instantaneous Vote}
\asubsubsection{Method of Vote}
The current President of the Open Works Collective will state all possible ways to vote, then call out each possibility one at a time.
The chairing member will count the number of members casting their instantaneous vote for that possibility. Instantaneous votes will be planned in advanced and will be held during meetings. The current President of the Open Works Collective will decided whether or not the subject being voted on should be instantaneous or scheduled.

% ARTICLE IV - AMENDING THIS CONSTITUTION
\article{Amending this Constitution}


\asection{Members}
The House Charter is a document drafted by the department of Residence Life, setting down the guidelines within which this House operates and from which it derives its authority.

\asection{Officers}
The House Constitution is written and maintained by the House and defines the major aspects, goals, and governing structure of the house.
It is reviewed annually by the Department of Residence Life.

\asubsection{Non-Semantic Changes}
There are two methods for non-semantic change to the Constitution.
A Maintainer may approve any proposed change that does not affect the meaning of the document.
Alternatively, the change may be presented to the House for discussion followed by an Immediate Vote.
A quorum of fifty percent of the Total Number of Possible Votes is required for passage.

\asubsection{Semantic Changes}
Any semantic change to the Constitution requires the change to be proposed in writing for discussion at a House Meeting.
Any modifications made due to the discussion are added to the written proposal and the modified proposal is posted in the House during the week.
The final proposal is presented the following week and ballots are distributed for a ballot House vote as described in \ref{Balloted Vote}.
The ballots are collected for a minimum of a forty-eight hour period.
A quorum of two-thirds of the Total Number of Possible Votes must cast ballots for the vote to be official.
A vote equaling or exceeding two-thirds of the number of votes cast is required for the change to be placed into the constitution.
The Constitution may be overridden by an immediate House vote as described in \ref{Immediate Vote}.
There must be a quorum of eighty-five percent of the Total Number of Possible Votes for the vote to be official.
A vote equaling or exceeding ninety percent of the number of votes cast is required for the override to take effect.

	\item Participate in discussion of proposals
